# 6940
69420 is a basic command-line game coded in python3, 

The main premise of the game is simply clicking enter, causing the game to begin randomly generating 5-digit numbers anywhere from 00000-99999 and this process will continue until the number "69420" is generated, once it is generated the process will stop and it will give you feedback about how long it took to reach 69420 and how many attempts the program made before getting there,

It also includes high and low score to track your best stats, you'll know when getting a new high/low score based on the [NEW] tag showed in the program.
